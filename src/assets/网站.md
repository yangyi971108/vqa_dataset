* About：

  **Computer Science Diagrams QA（CSDQA）** is a computer science domain dataset with rich annotations supervision. It contains a total of 1,294 diagrams in 12 categories from five undergraduate courses: *Data structure*, *Principles of Computer Networks*, *Computer Architecture*, *Digital Logic Circuit*, and *Computer Operating System*. The CSDQA dataset is designed to evaluate algorithms on the tasks of object detection and  question answering in the geometric shapes diagrams scenario. Diagrams in CSDQA come from textbooks, blogs, encyclopedias and other educational resources. The annotations are completed by trained domain experts with plenty of time.
